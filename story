Once upon a time there was a man, named Tommy shelby.
He was a dangerous man !

Tommy Shelby happend to visit Rajkot to meet U____ at imporwised tech....
He did bring his brothers along with him. Arthur, John and Finn were not so happy about meeting U____ .
U started talking about how he has a really nice and fancy router. Which ofcc did not add any value to the Shelby gang. Now Arthur could not hold it and just puched U and broke his tooth and now he looks like a pirate.
As U stumbled back, clutching his broken tooth, Arthur leaned in with a smirk and a touch of British wit, "Now, now, chap, let's have a bit of honesty, shall we? Else we might have to resort to more... unconventional methods to get the truth out of you!"
